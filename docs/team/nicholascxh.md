## Overview

Our product, **Cashflow**, is a CLI-based application that allows users to record, categorize, and analyze their personal expenses and income. It supports commands to add, edit, delete, sort, and list financial transactions by date and category. The app is optimized for fast and lightweight usage, ideal for users who prefer a non-GUI financial tracking tool.

I was responsible for implementing the core features that manage expense and income entries, including command parsing, logic execution, and unit testing. My work emphasized clean separation of concerns and extensibility.
